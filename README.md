I am a proud member of the TAMU Model Train Club and the one and only rule of the TAMU Model Train Club is no model trains in the TAMU Model Train Club. <br>

Constable here ensures that no one in the Official TAMU Model Train Club discord server talks about model trains.<br>

Trains are big model trains so trains have also been banned from the TAMU Model Train Club.
